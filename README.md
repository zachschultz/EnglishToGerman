# EnglishToGerman

This is just a fun little project I'm working on while I'm here in Germany.

It lets the user enter a word in English or German then returns the equivalent in the opposite language, including the gender-related article if in German.

## Ideas I would like to implement
- If the word cant be found (and is then assumed to be misspelled), I want the program to smartly run through the dictionary and return alternatives.
 - These alternatives would then have a unique number that the user could enter if they wished and then be presented with that word's info.

As of now, it is being written in Java, but soon I am going to re-write it in JavaScript and make it a webapp. This will hopefully be a lot more convenient than running it through the console.

It's been a while since I've written a Java program with more than one class, so I'm also rusty on how to organize the program, so don't make fun.
